Microtubules (MTs) are filaments of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton assembled from the protein tubulin. Among their many roles, MTs represent the principal structural components of the mitotic spindle, are essential in maintaining cell shape, motility and to facilitate intracellular transport and intracellular communication. Tubulin is a heterodimer of alpha- and beta-subunits; the sequence, and structure of tubulin subunits is highly conserved among species. Many eukaryotic organisms carry multiple genomic copies of functional α or β tubulin, commonly referred to as isoforms (or isotypes if they are confined to a single organism) whose protein sequences are very well conserved. In humans for example, 9 genes encode for the α-subunit whereas 10 genes encode the β-subunit which are assembled into functional microtubule polymers. Mutations in different mammalian tubulin proteins have been linked to a wide range of disorders many of which affect brain development (Mark I. Rees et al, 2014)
